## General info
I created this api to demonstrate my abilities as software developer.

## Technologies

* Spring Boot (Actuator, Security, JPA)
* H2 (In memory)
* JUnit
* Flyway
* Jackson Mapper
* Basic Authentication
* Docker
* Swagger2

## Decisions Made:
* URL Shortener: Once I have never created an URL shortner I focused on my strenghts. During the week I will update the project with a solution for this.
* Security: Basic Authentication on the data in transit in order to ensure a reliable communication to the single test application. Think about the use of oAuth2 instead of basic authentication for 
solution which requires a high level of security.  
* Spring boot: Once I have a large background with java Springboot was the natural choose. With Spring is possible to create robust apis in few lines of code.
* H2: The best solution to integrate natively with spring-data.
* Flyway: To create the database as a code using the migrations 
* JUNIT: All of the unit tests were created using junit and Mockito. Because of few time to conclude the task I created the Unit tests only to the service layer.
* One single project: Once this is a small test to evaluate my skills I have invlude everything in one single project. It is recommended to split on small project in order to be possible increase the individual scalability. 
* Swagger2: One of the most used framework to document apis.
* Lack Integration tests: Once it is possible to test the api through Swagger Integration tests weren't created.
* Exception handling: Use standard (SQLException, JDBCException...) exceptions instead of custom. 
* Logging: Rolling appender should be considered to rotate the log file to avoid large files on the storage.
